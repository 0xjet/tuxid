# tuxid
A Linux fingerprinting tool

## Overview

`tuxid` is a tool for performing local device fingerprinting on Linux and Linux-based systems. The fingerprint produced by `tuxid` is derived from multiple system, network, and hardware signals and can be used to re-identify the device at a subsequent time.

The accompanying paper (not yet available) describes the design of `tuxid`, the signal catalog, and an evaluation of the estimated entropy, lifetime, resetability, and accessibility of each signal.
